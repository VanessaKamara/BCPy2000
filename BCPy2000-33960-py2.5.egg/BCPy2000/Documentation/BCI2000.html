It is written and maintained by Gerwin Schalk and JÃ¼rgen Mellinger.</p><p>We decided to base our system on BCI2000 because it is a free, actively developed and already very comprehensive system which is fast becoming a <em>de facto</em> standard in BCI research. Its file format is particularly well suited for BCI research, is familiar to many researchers, and is supported by a number of cross-platform analysis tools. Its modularity makes it easy to port experiments between different signal acquisition hardware setups (of which an impressively wide range is supported). Finally, despite its unlimited reconfigurability and extensibility, its front-end can be made usable by relatively non-technical end-users.</p><p>The official site of the project is located at <a class="url http outside" href="http://bci2000.org">http://bci2000.org</a> and includes a <a class="url http outside" href="http://doc.bci2000.org/">wiki</a>.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-04-10 23:30 UTC by localhost <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
