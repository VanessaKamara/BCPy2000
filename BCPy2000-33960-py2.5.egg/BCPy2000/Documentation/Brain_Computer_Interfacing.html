The aim is to decode a user's intentions in a communication or control task, directly from live measurements of that user's brain activity, measured usually by EEG or (increasingly) by surgically implanted electrodes. At the time of writing, such systems are still very much in the research-and-development stages, but they have the potential to improve the lives of many people (such as those paralysed by conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) who would otherwise be completely unable to communicate.</p><p>We see the BCI development task as consisting of four challenges:</p><ol><li><em>Induction</em>: what mental task should the user engage in (for example, focusing attention on one of a number of different stimuli, or engaging in a particular imagination task) in order to produce measurable, discriminable patterns of brain activity as reliably as possible?</li><li><em>Measurement</em>: what technology should be used to detect and record the user's modulation of their brain activity?</li><li><em>Decoding</em>: how can the brain signals be most robustly, reliably and accurately processed in order to infer what the user was trying to do?</li><li><em>Integration</em>: how should the decoded information be used in order to achieve whatever task the user is trying to achieve? What user interface and what form of feedback is most efficient and easy to use?</li></ol><p>Currently, for clinical applications most BCI systems still require considerable development of the first 3 points, before integration becomes the performance-limiting factor.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2008-08-11 09:00 UTC by localhost <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
