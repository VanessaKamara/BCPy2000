The result is a powerful, easy-to-learn and easy-to-use system which has become popular for a very wide range of applications, including <a class="local canonical" title="SciPy" href="SciPy.html">scientific computing</a>.</p><p>Our experience with python has been mostly positive. Often we embark on the implementation of a new task, write the first three lines of python, and then realize, "oh, that's it." And then it works.</p><p>The official site is <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a>.</p><p>We have had BCPy2000 working on both <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.4/">Python 2.4</a> and <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.4/">Python 2.5</a>. The latter currently seems to be the most widely-adopted and -supported Python version among scientists, and is the version we recommend.</p><p>Many people are beginning to adopt <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.6.2/">Python 2.6</a>, and our basic framework has worked under this, but since binary installers were not available for <a class="local" href="VisionEgg.html">VisionEgg</a> at the time of writing (September 2009) we have not fully tested the application module. Support for <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.python.org/doc/3.0/">Python 3.0</a>+, for us as for all of the projects we depend on, will probably take a while.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-09-16 18:57 UTC by musi.kyb.local <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
