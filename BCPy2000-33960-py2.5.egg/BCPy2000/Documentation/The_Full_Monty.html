Python is a very good language for beginners: the code that our target <a class="local canonical" title="Developer" href="Developer.html">developers</a> need to write looks simple and easy, our <a class="local canonical" title="Demo" href="Demo.html">demos</a> look user-friendly and fun, and indeed we want to encourage people into programming through this route. However, in order for the developer to get as far as trying the demos out, or even writing their own "Hello World" program, we have to get them to install <a class="local" href="Python.html">Python</a> and various other third-party <a class="local canonical" title="Python_Packages" href="Python_Packages.html">Python packages</a> first: and <em>that</em> can get complicated.</p><p>Hence: The Full Monty. This is the name we give to our downloadable, standalone, portable <a class="local" href="Python.html">Python</a> distribution, pre-loaded with <a class="local canonical" title="Framework" href="Framework.html">the BCPy2000 package</a> and all the required <a class="local canonical" title="Python_Packages" href="Python_Packages.html">third-party dependencies</a>. It can be <a class="local canonical" title="Download" href="Download.html">downloaded</a> together with our <a class="local canonical" title="Demo" href="Demo.html">demo</a> distribution in one zip-file. The demos are then launched via the <code>.bat</code> files in the <code>BCI2000/batch</code> subdirectory.</p><p>The BCPy2000-plus-Full-Monty download is primarily intended to be an "instant" demonstration for people who are not familiar with Python. Once you have a better idea how things work, you may want to consider whether it is better to continue using the Full Monty, or to install and manage your own system-wide Python installation.</p><div class="toc"><h2>Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#Heading1">Advantages and disadvantages</a><ol><li><a href="#Heading2">No installation required</a></li><li><a href="#Heading3">Everything included</a></li><li><a href="#Heading4">Extra features</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#Heading5">Troubleshooting</a></li><li><a href="#Heading6">Updating</a></li></ol></div><hr /><h1 id="Heading1">Advantages and disadvantages</h1><p>There are various advantages to choosing the Full Monty, as opposed to installing and setting up your own Python distribution. However, since any full Python distribution is a fairly large and complex entity, there are inevitably some disadvantages and caveats, too.</p><h2 id="Heading2">No installation required</h2><ul><li><strong>Advantage</strong>: You only need to download and expand one file, and then you can use it where it stands. The Python distribution is fully "portable", as is the BCPy2000 demo that uses it: either of them can be used from the Desktop, from a removable medium, or wherever you choose to leave them.</li><li><strong>Corresponding disadvantage</strong>: no installation is performed, which means that your Windows operating system knows nothing about it and hasn't done any of the usual preparatory housekeeping that Python expects when it is used outside the context of BCI2000. Python <code>.py</code> script files, when double-clicked from Windows Explorer, will not necessarily open with <em>this</em> copy of Python — and if they do, they will probably not know where to find any of the standard modules they try to import. To use this Python distribution for more general purposes, you would always have to ensure that the environmental variables <code>PYTHONHOME</code> and <code>PATH</code> are set correctly, which is what we do in our demo batch files and in the standalone <code>IPython.bat</code> that we supply.</li></ul><h2 id="Heading3">Everything included</h2><ul><li><strong>Advantage</strong>: everything you need has been included for you already in a single download: a complete Python distribution, plus the long list of third-party dependencies, as well as the minimal set of BCI2000 files required to make up the demo.</li><li><strong>Corresponding disadvantage</strong>: it's a fairly big download of around 60 MB, expanding to 200 MB or more. (By analogy, imagine that we were to provide a downloadable demo of the <code>MatlabSignalProcessing</code> module that <em>included</em> the whole of Matlab with all of its toolboxes... At least, with Python, redistributing the whole thing in this way <em>is</em> legally possible.)</li></ul><h2 id="Heading4">Extra features</h2><ul><li><strong>Advantage</strong>: we have added a few extras to the Full Monty and pre-configured them to help with usability. For example, we've included a nice Python editor, <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.scintilla.org">Scite</a>. Furthermore, when you type <code>edit</code>, Scite (or whatever other editor you have chosen) responds in a more Matlab-like (and hence, to us, more intuitive) way than IPython's default behaviour. The <code>desk</code> and <code>easy_install</code> IPython commands, both useful for updating your framework and other packages (see below), are also our own additions.</li><li><strong>Corresponding disadvantage</strong>: you cannot expect these things to be present in other Python or IPython environments. These extra commands are imported from <code>BCPy2000.Shortcuts</code>, and you should be aware that the line that imports this has been added to the default <code>ipy_user_conf.py</code>. If you have your own <code>ipy_user_conf.py</code> file, or have changed the <code>IPYTHONDIR</code> environmental variable, then these commands may not be available until you explicitly import them.</li></ul><hr /><h1 id="Heading5">Troubleshooting</h1><p>In the case of an <a class="local canonical" title="Errors" href="Errors.html">error</a>, check the following Full-Monty-specific possibilities:</p><ul><li>Did you mess with anything before running, such as perhaps moving or renaming any files or directories? If you decide, for example, that you want to move the supplied BCI2000 files somewhere else relative to the Full Monty, or rename the Full Monty directory, it is possible that the BCI2000 files will no longer know where the Python distribution is. In our demo there is a file <code>prog/portable.bat</code> in which this is configured, specifically so that a "portable" Python distro can be found.</li><li>During installation or at runtime, did you get an error claiming that a particular file or directory, with a specified long path, could not be found, despite the fact that it patently <em>does</em> exist? This could be because Windows has an intrinsic (and moronic) limitation of 255 characters on filesystem path lengths. Since the Python distribution, together with some of its toolboxes, can be a very deep tree, the limit may be exceeded if you have put the Full Monty tree inside <br /><code>C:\Documents and Settings\Charles Louis Xavier Joseph de la Vallée Poussin\My Documents\Things I Downloaded Last Sunday\</code><br /> although it seems just-about OK if it's in <br /><code>C:\Documents and Settings\jez\Desktop</code><br /> If in doubt, why not just expand it inside <code>C:\</code> ?</li></ul><hr /><h1 id="Heading6">Updating</h1><p>All packages in the Full Monty are installed and managed using <code>easy_install</code>, which is itself part of the <code>setuptools</code> package. Let's assume you have downloaded a new version of the BCPy2000 <a class="local canonical" title="Framework" href="Framework.html">framework</a> as an <code>.egg</code> or <code>.exe</code> file, and placed this file on the desktop. The following example illustrates how to update. The new package will be installed alongside any previous versions, but the previous versions will be ignored in future Python sessions, and can be deleted manually from <code>Lib/site-packages</code> or left there to rot, as you wish.</p><pre class="real">In [1]: desk
