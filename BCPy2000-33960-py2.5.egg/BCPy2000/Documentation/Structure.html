It consists of:</p><ul><li>A number of <a class="local canonical" title="Dependencies" href="Dependencies.html">dependencies</a> (the <a class="local" href="Python.html">Python</a> programming language itself, and a number of third-party <a class="local canonical" title="Python_Packages" href="Python_Packages.html">python packages</a>) which you must first install on your computer.</li><li>The <a class="local canonical" title="Foundation" href="Foundation.html">foundation</a> consisting of a collection of official <a class="local" href="BCI2000.html">BCI2000</a> binaries as well as the python-specific binaries contributed by <a class="local canonical" title="Credits" href="Credits.html">us</a>. By convention these are kept in a directory called <code>prog</code>.</li><li>Standing on top of the foundation is the <a class="local canonical" title="Framework" href="Framework.html">framework</a> written by <a class="local canonical" title="Credits" href="Credits.html">us</a>. This consists of python files which provide the glue between the BCI2000 binaries and your developer files, and which also implement <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> methods for you to call in your python code. By default, these files are expected to be installed as a python package.</li><li>Supported by the framework are the <a class="local canonical" title="Developer_Files" href="Developer_Files.html">developer files</a> written by <a class="local canonical" title="Developer" href="Developer.html">you</a>, implementing the specific behaviour of the modules. By default, they go in the <code>..\python</code> directory relative to <code>prog</code>.</li><li>In addition, we are in the process of writing a number of <a class="local canonical" title="Tools" href="Tools.html">higher-level tools</a> which will hopefully form as a sort of standard library for BCPy2000 development. In the current release, however, documentation for the tools is incomplete.</li></ul></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-09-16 18:49 UTC by musi.kyb.local <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
