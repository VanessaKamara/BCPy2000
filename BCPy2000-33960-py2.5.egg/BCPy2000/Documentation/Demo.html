The python source files used to implement their behaviour, and the sound files used for feedback, are found in the <code>python</code> directory.</p><div class="toc"><h2>Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#Heading1">The Techno Triangle</a></li><li><a href="#Heading2">The Same Again, Please</a></li><li><a href="#Heading3">No Bells or Whistles</a></li></ol></div><h1 id="Heading1">The Techno Triangle</h1><p>The first demo is launched by double-clicking on <code>PythonDemo1_Triangle.bat</code> in the <code>batch</code> directory. Edit this file and take a look at the contents: it starts <a class="local canonical" title="Signal_Source_Binary" href="Signal_Source_Binary.html">PythonSource.exe</a> with a <a class="local canonical" title="Command-line_Options" href="Command-line_Options.html">command-line option</a> specifying <code>TrefoilSource.py</code> as the signal source module implementation, <a class="local canonical" title="Signal_Processing_Binary" href="Signal_Processing_Binary.html">PythonSignalProcessing.exe</a> with no developer file (simple pass-through processing), and <a class="local canonical" title="Application_Binary" href="Application_Binary.html">PythonApplication.exe</a> with <code>TriangleApplication.py</code> as the application module implementation. It also ensures that the operator loads the necessary parameter file automatically: you should be able to press "Set Config" immediately (although there may be a minute's delay for compilation of various things if you've never used the system before) and then "Start".</p><p><code>TriangleApplication.py</code> is a toy BCI experiment in which the subject imagines moving left hand, right hand or feet in order to guide the cursor into one of the three corners of the triangle. At the same time, depending on the parameter settings of the <code>PythonApp</code> tab, the subject receives  colour feedback and sound feedback - each imagination task is associated with a colour and/or a continuous sound, and these get brighter/louder as the probability of the associated class increases.</p><p>The application module expects an input signal of 3 or 4 channels, the value of which should be the estimated probability of each of the classes (the optional 4th channel is the probability of the zero class or "rest" class). In fact, in the demo, no such sensible values are delivered: <code>TrefoilSource.py</code> just generates an artificial 3-channel signal that makes the cursor visit each of the corners in turn, and the signal-processing module passes this through unchanged.</p><p>The triangle demo showcases a number of the optional higher-level <a class="local canonical" title="Tools" href="Tools.html">tools</a> - note, for example, the "state monitors" that show you the value of certain state variables. These are turned off (according to the logic implemented in <code>TriangleApplication.py</code>'s <code>Initialize</code> hook) if you also turn off the packet clock in the bottom right corner, by unchecking the <code>ShowSignalTime</code> parameter.</p><p>Note the interactivity of the modules. For example, in the <code>PythonSig</code> shell, type the following: <br /><code>self.Process = lambda x: x.A**2</code><br /> and notice that the cursor now goes deeper into the corners due to the new "signal processing".</p><h1 id="Heading2">The Same Again, Please</h1><p>The second demo is launched by opening <code>PythonDemo2_Playback.bat</code>. Here we see the same application, but the signal and experimental sequence are in fact played back from the first file you recorded using demo 1 (or from whatever file you specify in the <code>PlaybackFileName</code> parameter of the <code>Source</code> tab). See the <a class="local canonical" title="Replay" href="Replay.html">documentation on playback mode</a> for more details.</p><h1 id="Heading3">No Bells or Whistles</h1><p>The third demo is launched from <code>PythonDemo3_Template.bat</code>. Here, very little happens. No parameter file is loaded, the default <a class="local canonical" title="Developer_File" href="Developer_File.html">developer file</a> names, <code>Bci*.py</code>, are used, and the implementations in these files are very minimal: didactically helpful, we hope, but experimentally meaningless.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-04-10 23:27 UTC by localhost <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
