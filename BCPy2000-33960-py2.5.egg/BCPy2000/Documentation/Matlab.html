We love it, and yet we hate it.</p><p>We have been well served by Matlab over the years, but we're all too conscious of the fact that one day either it will be have to be free, or we will have to be free of it. Upgrading costs money and breaks your code. Updating your code breaks compatibility with your colleagues who haven't spent the money to upgrade. Freezing your version (a strategy we've seen in at least two major machine-learning departments) leaves you stuck with whatever bugs happened to be trapped in the amber at the time. Maintaining publicly available toolboxes, for users who inevitably and incurably possess differing versions, is a constant and pointless hassle. And let's say nothing of the phenomenon of one's department's pool of licenses running dry in the middle of a batch of jobs. There are reasons why open-source software is so popular among scientists; cost is among the least of these.</p><p>In the machine-learning world there have been workshops entirely devoted to the topic of how we might <a class="local canonical" title="Migration" href="Migration.html">wean ourselves away from Matlab</a>, and numerous projects that aim to do so. One of the aims of BCPy2000 is to extend this effort into the field of BCI.</p><p>BCPy2000 would not have been possible without Matlab.</p><p>BCPy2000 does not use Matlab.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-03-30 15:17 UTC by localhost <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
