This means that platform-independence for the whole BCI2000 project is still some time away.</p><p>However, early porting of the Python-based modules to other platforms has been made relatively easy by the portable nature of Python itself. We have had some success in running them on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, although a Windows machine is still required for the Operator. Soon after the essential functions of the Operator module are separated from its UI functions (one of the project's <a class="url http outside" href="http://bci2000.org/tracproj">milestones</a> for 2009) it should be possible, in principle, to run entirely Windows-free (although note that the drivers for most commercial EEG signal acquisition systems, and hence also most Signal Source modules, will probably remain Windows-dependent for the foreseeable future).</p><p>As of the 11336 release (March 2009), the <code>gbuild</code> bash scripts can be used to build BCPy2000's three foundation binaries with gcc. On Windows, this means using <a class="url http outside" href="http://cygwin.com">cygwin</a>, and the <code>-mno-cygwin</code> flag is passed to gcc (tested with gcc 3.4.4).</p><p>Here are our experiences with other platforms so far. We have not yet performed any testing beyond an initial run to prove that the <a class="local canonical" title="Demo" href="Demo.html">demos</a> work. Please let us know (using the <a class="local canonical" title="Support" href="Support.html">support</a> e-mail address) if you manage to get any further.</p><h3>GNU/Linux</h3><p>On Ubuntu hardy running on i686 and compiling with gcc 4.2.3, everything seemed to run, except for sound stimuli since I haven't managed to get PyAudio working on that distro. VisionEgg failed to operate at anything above 16 bits per pixel, and rendering was very slow - presumably due to suboptimal graphics setup on my particular system.</p><h3>Mac OS X</h3><p>Under Mac OSX (10.5) on i386 and compiling with gcc 4.0.1, likewise all modules run. Getting VisionEgg working at all on OSX is a challenge, but once this works, BCPy2000 does too.</p><p>On Windows and Linux, the <code>-DDYNAMIC_PYTHON=1</code> flag may be used, allowing the binary to be compiled independent of any particular Python version so that the desired Python shared library and distribution can be chosen via a command-line switch when the executable is launched. On OSX, however, the result gave an "Illegal Instruction" message when run. Only executables compiled with <code>-DDYNAMIC_PYTHON=0</code> and statically linked to a particular Python library have worked for me on OSX so far.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-09-14 19:05 UTC by localhost <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
