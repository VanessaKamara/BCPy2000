So far we have not been able to eliminate framedrops entirely.</li><li>BCI2000 timing does not work smoothly on virtual machines. Your mileage may also vary considerably as regards the performance of OpenGL and <a class="local" href="VisionEgg.html">VisionEgg</a>. The BCPy2000 <a class="local canonical" title="Demo" href="Demo.html">demos</a> have worked for me in a <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a>, but were slow, jerky and ugly. The application module has got particularly slow (using 100% CPU all the time and slowing everything down to a crawl) as of release 11336, but this doesn't seem to be a problem on non-virtual win32 machines.</li><li>Our <a class="local" href="EventOffset.html">EventOffset</a> mechanism seems to work with reasonably high <em>precision</em>, but still sometimes low <em>accuracy</em>: sound recording tests show a bias that seems to be parameter-dependent. It is constant for a given parameter setting, however, so it's not much of a problem for BCI purposes (just turns P300s consistently into, say, P350s). In any case, note that a physical synchronization signal is always a much better option.</li></ul></li><li>Shell<ul><li>Pressing ctrl-C at the shell prompt causes the main thread to be interrupted and the whole module breaks. This is by design in IPython, but it would be nice to prevent it since it's sometimes useful to be able to send a ctrl-C just to the shell environment itself (to get out of stupid multi-line bracket-nesting traps for example). I just don't know how to disable this feature yet.</li><li>Shells do not save their histories when they quit. Adding a <code>self._ipshell.IP.savehist()</code> call seems to work, but only very intermittently (perhaps due to race conditions when more than one module is running a shell?)</li></ul></li><li>Debugger<ul><li>Whenever the pdb debugger (launched by <code>self.</code><a class="local anchor" href="BciCore.html#BciCore-dbstop">dbstop</a>) quits, it throws an exception of type Bdb (presumably by design). It's not clear where to catch this without hacking the debugger's own source, so currently the debugger is a one-shot deal: you can go into it, but never out of it without restarting the whole system. You can, however, issue the <code>c</code> command for 'continue'.</li><li>When the debugger opens, it and the shell prompt are running in parallel threads and they are <strong>both</strong> listening to your keyboard strokes. I've performed a wild hack in order to prevent this, but the hack is only effective from the second line onwards. Therefore it's a good idea to press 'return' once at the beginning of a debugger session - IPython should then suspend itself and let you debug in peace (although it seems to come back very occasionally, under circumstances that are not quite clear...)</li></ul></li><li>Non-Windows<ul><li>On <a class="local" href="Cross-Platform_Portability.html">non-win32 platforms</a> only: when a shell and a log file are used simultaneously, IPython's <code>[Out]</code> output goes to the log file (where, by the convention we have established under Windows, it is not wanted) and not to screen (where it definitely is wanted).</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-03-17 00:48 UTC by <a class="author" title="from localhost" href="jez.html">jez</a> <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
