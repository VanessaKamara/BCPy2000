It is based on, and hosted by, the <a class="local" href="BCI2000.html">BCI2000</a> project. From the developer's point of view, the implementation is carried out in <a class="local canonical" title="Python" href="Python.html">python</a>, taking advantage of various high-level packages: <a class="local" href="VisionEgg.html">VisionEgg</a> for stimulus presentation, <a class="local" href="NumPy.html">NumPy</a> and <a class="local" href="SciPy.html">SciPy</a> for signal processing and classification, and <a class="local" href="IPython.html">IPython</a> for interactive debugging.</p><p>Being a BCI2000 system, it is modular, consisting of an Application module (the stimulus presentation part), a Signal Processing module (the machine-learning part), and a Signal Source module (the toy data generation part). You can choose to use Python to implement one, two, or all three of these modules, and use other pre-existing BCI2000 modules for the remainder of the system (for example, for the Signal Source, you can choose from BCI2000's comprehensive range of EEG acquisition modules). The modules communicate over TCP/IP, so they can run on different machines (and possibly <a class="local canonical" title="Cross-Platform_Portability" href="Cross-Platform_Portability.html">different operating systems</a>) if necessary.</p><p>BCPy2000 is aimed at <a class="local canonical" title="Developer" href="Developer.html">developers</a>. Our emphasis is on getting you to the stage where you can implement a BCI2000 module based entirely on your own python code. We provide a lot of infrastructure to allow you to do so quickly, but the details of exactly how you classify your signals, or how you arrange your stimuli in space and time, are going to be left to you. We do provide a <a class="local canonical" title="Demo" href="Demo.html">demo</a> implementation which makes use of some <a class="local canonical" title="Tools" href="Tools.html">optional higher-level tools</a> that you may also find useful. However, the optional tools are currently incompletely documented. We're sure your own implementations will be better anyway.</p><p>To learn more, you may wish to take a look at how the system is <a class="local canonical" title="Structure" href="Structure.html">structured</a>. If you already know BCPy2000, you may wish to have a look at what has been <a class="local" href="Changelog.html">changing</a> recently</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-04-10 22:09 UTC by localhost <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
