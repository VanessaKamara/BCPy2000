<div class="content"><p>By default, console windows under the Windows operating system look awful, and display so little text at any one time that attempting to do any serious work with them is like threading a needle while wearing boxing gloves. To make them more pleasant to work with, you can follow the instructions below, or implement them all in one go using <a class="local" href="console.reg">this (WindowsXP) registry hack</a> (download the .reg file to disk, then double-click it).</p><ol><li>Click on the icon in the top left of the shell window and select "Defaults" from the menu.</li><li>Now, under "Font" tab, choose "Lucida Console" or whatever is available as an alternative to the ugly "Raster Fonts". Then select size 10, 12 or 14.</li><li>Next, go to the "Layout" tab and, under "Window Size" mid-right, give yourself something like Width=125 and Height=45, so you can actually see a reasonable quantity of text at any one time.</li><li>Finally go to the "Options" tab and make sure that "QuickEdit Mode" is <strong>disabled</strong> (often QuickEdit mode is useful, but we've found that it's too easy to make the BCI2000 hang by inadvertently clicking on a console window and putting one of the modules into a blocking text-selection mode).</li></ol><p> Now, next time you open a console window - see how much better it looks? You can also change these settings on a per-application basis by choosing "Properties" instead of "Defaults".</p></div>
