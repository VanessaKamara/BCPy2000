The first part is the "BCPy2000 Foundation", consisting of </p><ul><li><code>PythonApplication.exe</code>,</li><li><code>PythonSignalProcessing.exe</code>,</li><li><code>PythonSource.exe</code>,</li></ul><p>and the parts of their C++ source code that are found under the <code>foundation</code> subtree of the BCPy2000 release. The foundation extends the <a class="local" href="BCI2000.html">BCI2000</a> platform, and links against it, its purpose being to allow BCI2000 to use the embedded Python API to communicate with any Python code (called a "Python framework") that conforms to a certain BCI2000-like structure. The BCPy2000 foundation is free software, which may be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html">GNU Lesser General Public License v. 3.0</a> reproduced in <code>foundation/COPYING.LESSER</code>.</p><p>Note that the BCPy2000 foundation is built on top of BCI2000, which is not covered by this license and which is not freely re-distributable, although its sources are available for free to researchers. See <a class="url http outside" href="http://bci2000.org/">http://bci2000.org/</a> and contact the project's maintainers for terms and conditions.</p><p>The second part is the "BCPy2000 Framework" which is an example of the kind of Python framework that the BCPy2000 foundation is designed to enable. It consists of the Python sources in the <code>framework</code> subtree of the BCPy2000 release. The BCPy2000 framework interfaces with the foundation, and is free software which may be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html">GNU General Public License (GPL) v 3.0</a> as reproduced in <code>framework/COPYING</code>.</p><p>The additional Python sources under the <code>demo</code> subtree are also under the GPL, since they depend on the BCPy2000 framework.</p><p>All source code and documentation in the BCPy2000 release is copyright (c) 2007-2009 Jeremy Hill, Thomas Schreiner, Christian Puzicha and Jason Farquhar.
