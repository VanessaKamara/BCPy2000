Usually a trial lasts several seconds, and may (as in the last example) be of variable length even in the same experiment. A trial might consist of a number of consecutive subtrials (particularly in a grid-speller experiment). Often, a trial is followed by a short pause called the inter-trial interval, which is a few seconds (preferably a somewhat randomized duration) in which the subject can blink/swallow/shift around/forget what they are supposed to be doing, before the next trial begins.</p><p>There is no necessity to break your experiment into trials, but it is very common. Therefore, if you want to do so, the <a class="local" href="BciApplication.html">BCPy2000 application module</a> automatically implements a <code>CurrentTrial</code> state which counts up to the number specified by the <code>TrialsPerBlock</code> parameter. The <a class="local canonical" title="Presentation_Phase" href="Presentation_Phase.html">presentation phase</a> on which <code>CurrentTrial</code> is incremented, and what to do when a <a class="local canonical" title="Block" href="Block.html">block</a> is over, are specified by the <a class="local anchor" href="BciGenericApplication.html#BciGenericApplication-design">self.design</a> API method.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2008-09-25 14:14 UTC by <a class="author" title="from localhost" href="jez.html">jez</a> <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
