Therefore, we can also only support (32-bit) Windows. So far, we have only been able to perform extensive testing of our system on Windows XP Professional SP2 and SP3.</p><p>However, a large proportion of the BCI2000 source-code is already cross-platform compatible, and we have had some success in compiling and running the BCPy2000 modules on <a class="local" href="Cross-Platform_Portability.html">other platforms</a>.</p><p>Note that, in any case, a large proportion of commercial EEG signal acquisition systems will remain Windows-dependent for the foreseeable future.</p><h2>BCI2000</h2><p>To use BCPy2000, you need the <a class="local" href="BCI2000.html">BCI2000</a> binaries. The bare minimum for a BCPy2000 <a class="local canonical" title="Demo" href="Demo.html">demo</a> is as follows:</p><ul><li>the central BCI2000 operator, <code>operat.exe</code>, from the main BCI2000 distribution;</li><li>our <a class="local canonical" title="Signal_Source_Binary" href="Signal_Source_Binary.html">PythonSource.exe</a> ;</li><li>our <a class="local canonical" title="Signal_Processing_Binary" href="Signal_Processing_Binary.html">PythonSignalProcessing.exe</a> ;</li><li>our <a class="local canonical" title="Application_Binary" href="Application_Binary.html">PythonApplication.exe</a>.</li></ul><p>In addition, to use the framework for real experiments, you will need whichever signal-acquisition binary from the main BCI2000 distribution is appropriate for your EEG hardware.</p><p>The BCI2000 source code and binaries are available for free to researchers. Note, however, that the BCI2000 project's support system is such that you will need to register and sign an agreement before you can access the full distribution. See the <a class="url http outside" href="http://bci2000.org/BCI2000/Download.html">BCI2000 website</a> for details.</p><p>The parts written by <a class="local canonical" title="Credits" href="Credits.html">us</a>, i.e. the python-specific C++ code for our three binaries, the <a class="local canonical" title="Framework" href="Framework.html">framework</a> that makes the bridge between BCI2000 and <a class="local" href="Python.html">Python</a>, and the optional Python <a class="local canonical" title="Tools" href="Tools.html">tools</a>, are <a class="local" href="License.html">open-source</a>. Our sources are also integrated into the official BCI2000 source distribution, under <code>src/contrib/BCPy2000/foundation</code> and can be <a class="local canonical" title="Building" href="Building.html">built</a> from there.</p><h2>Python</h2><p>Before you can use BCPy2000, you must install <a class="local canonical" title="Python" href="Python.html">python</a> and a number of third-party <a class="local canonical" title="Python_Packages" href="Python_Packages.html">python packages</a>. BCPy2000 admittedly has a lot of dependencies, but all of them are free open-source packages, and most of them should be directly useful to you as <a class="local canonical" title="Developer" href="Developer.html">developer</a>, just as they were for us in building the <a class="local canonical" title="Framework" href="Framework.html">framework</a>.</p><p>Our framework itself is also a Python package. The files are included in the BCI2000 source distribution under <code>src/contrib/BCPy2000/framework</code> and can be <a class="local canonical" title="Building" href="Building.html">installed</a> from there.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-03-14 01:44 UTC by localhost <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
