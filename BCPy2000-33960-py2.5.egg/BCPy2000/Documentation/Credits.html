By the time he submitted his Diploma thesis in April 2008, the BCPy2000 application module was already in use in a real patient BCI project, and already fulfilling its promise of increasing flexibility and saving a great deal of development time.</p><p>Since Thomas moved on to better-paid things, Jez and research assistant <a class="local" href="Christian_Puzicha.html">Christian Puzicha</a> have given the BCPy2000 the philosopher's-axe treatment a couple of times over, to bring it from a beta to a releasable state, and expand it to enable python-based signal processing and test-signal generation. However, the system still owes its form and philosophy to Thomas and Jason's work. It is currently maintained by <a class="local canonical" title="jez" href="jez.html">Jez</a>.</p><p>We're grateful for the beta-testing efforts of Mike Bensch and <a class="local" href="Bernd_Battes.html">Bernd Battes</a>, both of whom were thrown into the murky undocumented depths. Many thanks also to Jürgen Mellinger and Gerwin Schalk for hosting the project, and for their help, advice and encouragement in integrating our work with the BCI2000.</p><p>During development we've been supported by the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft in Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf's department of the <a class="local" href="Max_Planck_Institute_for_Biological_Cybernetics.html">Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics</a>, and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under SFB550.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2008-09-30 18:23 UTC by <a class="author" title="from localhost" href="jez.html">jez</a> <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
