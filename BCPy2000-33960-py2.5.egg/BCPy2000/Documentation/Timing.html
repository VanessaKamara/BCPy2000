This requirement is of course applicable whether you have extended BCI2000 with your own code in Python, C++, Matlab or whatever. Not all Signal Source modules tell you when your real-time loop takes too long and you are skipping signal packets.</p><p>In addition, BCPy2000 handles stimulus timing in a different way from the BCI2000 C++ framework, via a separate <a class="local canonical" title="Phase_Machine" href="Phase_Machine.html">phase machine</a> thread. This allows arbitrary timing of the stimuli (not locked to the <a class="local canonical" title="Packet" href="Packet.html">packet</a> rate) at the expense of being able to localize stimuli based on state variables alone, closer than +/- one packet, even under ideal conditions. Note the assumption of ideal conditions: even in BCI2000's base C++ framework, state variables were not intended as a substitute for having a physical timing signal recorded in the data stream---for example, a TTL signal from the parallel port or, safer still, a physical recording of the light or sound produced by a stimulus. Therefore, do not take it for granted that you will be able to localize your stimulus onsets precisely in time, based on state variables alone---at least until you have been able to verify this objectively in your particular setup.</p><p>Once an experiment has been timing-tested, if the hardware to do such tests is unavailable, or not safety-rated, to record the physical stimulus during actual experimentation, then the "event offset" mechanism may offer some form of fallback. It has worked well in some of our applications, but should still be considered experimental. Your mileage may, and probably will, vary, depending on: </p><ul><li>your hardware;</li><li>your sampling rate;</li><li>the complexity of your stimulus display;</li><li>the speed-optimality of <a class="local canonical" title="Developer_File" href="Developer_File.html">the Python code that you have written</a>.</li></ul><h1>EventOffset</h1><p>The <a class="local" href="BciGenericApplication.html">BciGenericApplication</a> superclass defines the <code>EventOffset</code> state, which is zero most of the time, but which is set to a non-zero value for the duration of one packet whenever a <a class="local canonical" title="Phase_Machine" href="Phase_Machine.html">phase transition</a> occurs. Its value reflects the offset, in samples, between the time that the signal was acquired, and the time at which <code>self.</code><a class="local anchor" href="BciGenericApplication.html#BciGenericApplication-Transition">Transition</a> was called. Estimated transition points are obtained by: </p><ol><li>finding the time-samples at which the <code>EventOffset</code> state changes from zero to a non-zero value;</li><li>stepping forward by a number of samples equal to the value to which <code>EventOffset</code> is changing, minus <code>2**(bits-1)</code>, where <code>bits</code> is the number of bits allocated to the state variable (currently 10).</li></ol><p>We have performed tests in which transitions occur at random intervals, each accompanied by a parallel-port marker and an annoying sound (with a sudden attack) whose physical waveform is recorded (albeit undersampled) by an EEG amp. On our machines, using packets of duration 40 msec and sampling at 500Hz, we found the following: </p><ul><li>Parallel-port markers issued immediately at the transitions could be localized with a standard error of +/- 1 msec or less.</li><li>Parallel-port markers locked to <a class="local" href="WavTools.html">WavTools</a><code>.player</code> sounds (via the <code>set_preplay_hook</code> method) were more like +/- 2 msec.</li><li>As of release 11336 (17th March 2009) a bugfix in <a class="local" href="WavTools.html">WavTools</a><code>.PyAudioInterface</code> has meant that PyAudio-implemented sounds are just as precisely localizable as those issued by the DirectSound binary---the latter will therefore not be included in the release after all. Sounds could be found with +/- 2 msec precision using <code>EventOffset</code>. Latency between parallel port marker and sound is around 30 msec, with a standard deviation of +/- 2 msec.</li><li>The event-offset mechanism still seems to have biases that we're trying to iron out (see <a class="local canonical" title="Known_Issues" href="Known_Issues.html">known issues</a>) but these do not cause a problem for automatic classification methods: precision matters more than accuracy.</li><li>Relying purely on the moments at which state variables can change their value, i.e. the packet boundaries, would typically get you +/- 14 msec at a packet length of 40 msec. Note that the BCI2000 C++ framework now has, as of roughly August 2008, a mechanism for changing state variable values on a sub-packet basis. Future BCPy2000 releases will aim to take advantage of this.</li></ul><p>The same experiment is also used to test <a class="local canonical" title="Video_timing" href="Video_timing.html">video timing</a>.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2009-09-14 19:38 UTC by localhost <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
