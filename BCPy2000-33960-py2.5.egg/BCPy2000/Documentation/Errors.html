If the name of the module begins with <code>Python</code> then it is one of the BCPy2000 modules. In this case, the error is from one of three sources:</p><ol><li>a serious bug in our C++ code (hopefully now extinct, or at least very rare);</li><li>failure to open a required python file (have you installed all the <a class="local canonical" title="Dependencies" href="Dependencies.html">dependencies</a>? have you spelled the name of your <a class="local canonical" title="Developer_File" href="Developer_File.html">developer file</a> correctly?);</li><li>an exception that was raised during the execution of python code.</li></ol><p>In the case of python exceptions, there are two general kinds:</p><ol><li>An exception which is an instance of <code>EndUserError</code> (or a subclass thereof) will deliver its message via the operator and clean up (closing the <a class="local" href="VisionEgg.html">VisionEgg</a> window, for example). Then, if the error occurred during the Preflight or Initialize stages, the system will wait for the user to adjust the parameters and retry pressing "Set Config". Otherwise it will wait for the user to press "Quit".</li><li>Any other kind of exception (whether caused by faulty python code, or deliberately raised by the developer) will issue an operator message that will probably contain the words "Python Error" and/or "BCI2000 must be restarted". Additionally it will cause a colourful IPython backtrace to appear in the corresponding module's console window. The system will not clean up (most objects will not be destroyed, and the VisionEgg window will remain open). The console window will stay open, preventing the module from quitting so that you can read the backtrace. All BCI2000 modules will have to be killed before you can re-try, which will involve you manually closing any console windows in which error backtraces appeared, in addition to quitting from the operator.</li></ol><p>So, if the system stops for no apparent reason, check the operator for messages, and check the BCPy2000 console windows for error backtraces. The backtrace should give you the information you need to start fixing the problem (perhaps using <code>pdb</code>, the python <a class="local anchor" href="BciCore.html#BciCore-dbstop">debugger</a>). If you are sure that the problem originates in one of the files <a class="local canonical" title="Framework" href="Framework.html">written by us</a> and want <a class="local canonical" title="Support" href="Support.html">support</a>, copy any backtraces you get so that you can send it with your error report. Copying and pasting from consoles is a little strange under Windows, but the menu from the icon in the top left corner of the console window should enable you to do it.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="Home.html">Home</a> <a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2008-09-25 23:05 UTC by <a class="author" title="from localhost" href="jez.html">jez</a> <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
