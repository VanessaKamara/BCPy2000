def TimingWindow(filename='.', ind=-1, save=None):
	"""
Recreate BCI2000's timing window offline, from a saved .dat file specified by <filename>.
It is also possible to supply a directory name as <filename>, and an index <ind> (default
value -1 meaning "the last run") to choose a file automatically from that directory.

Based on BCI2000's   src/shared/modules/signalsource/DataIOFilter.cpp where the timing window
content is computed in DataIOFilter::Process(), this is what appears to happen:
    
         Begin SampleBlock #t:
            Enter SignalSource module's first Process() method (DataIOFilter::Process)
            Save previous SampleBlock to file
            Wait to acquire new SampleBlock from hardware
 +--------- Measure SourceTime in SignalSource module
 |   |   |  Make a local copy of all states (NB: all except SourceTime were set during #t-1) ---+
B|  R|  S|  Pipe the signal through the rest of BCI2000                                         |
 |   |   +- Measure StimulusTime in Application module, on leaving last Process() method        |
 |   |                                                                                          |
 |   |                                                                                          |
 |   |   Begin SampleBlock #t+1:                                                                |
 |   +----- Enter SignalSource module's first Process() method (DataIOFilter::Process)          |
 |          Save data from #t, SourceTime state from #t, and other states from #t-1, to file <--+
 |          Wait to acquire new SampleBlock from hardware
 +--------- Measure SourceTime in SignalSource module
            Make a local copy of all states (NB: all except SourceTime were set during #t)
            Leave DataIOFilter::Process() and pipe the signal through the rest of BCI2000
            Measure StimulusTime in Application module, on leaving last Process() method

B stands for Block duration.
R stands for Roundtrip time (visible in VisualizeTiming, not reconstructable from the .dat file)
S is the filter cascade time (marked "Stimulus" in the VisualizeTiming window).

Note that, on any given SampleBlock as saved in the file, SourceTime will be *greater* than
any other timestamp states (including StimulusTime), because it is the only state that is
updated in time to be saved with the data packet it belongs to. All the others lag by one
packet.  This is corrected for at the point commented with ??? in the Python code.
